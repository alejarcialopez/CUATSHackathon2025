This is the first Hackathon I have attended. The first five hours are workshops introducing you to common data structures and algorithms together with practice problems. 
At midnight, problems are released. These consist of Leetcode medium/hard questions.

Problems:

01 / 01: TwoSum
  Problem: Given an array of numbers, output two distinct indices for which their respective elements add up to a target integer.
  Key idea: loop through the elements and use a hashmap to "remember" already seen numbers so that they can be accessed in O(1) if needed.
